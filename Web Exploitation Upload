# Command Injection
    Application on the server is vulnerable,
    allowing execution of arbitrary commands
    
    User input not validated
    
    Common example is a SOHO router, with a web page to allow ping
    
    Might contain the following in itâ€™s code:
    
      system("ping -c 1 ".$_GET["ip"]);
    
    Run the following to chain/stack our arbitrary command
    
      ; cat /etc/passwd
